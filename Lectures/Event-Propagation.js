-> THE EVENT PROPAGATION IS A VERY IMPORATNT CONCEPT IN JAVASCRIPT.
-> IT IS THE CONCEPT OF HOW EVENTS BEHAVES BEHIND THE SCENES.

-> IF WE HAVE AN HTML DOCUMENT, WHERE AN ANCHOR TAG IS CREATED.

-> SO , WHEN A USER CLICKS ON ANCHOR , THE EVENT HAPPENS BEHIND THE SCENES.

-> THE EVENT FIRST GOES INTO THE CAPTURING PHASE IN WHICH THE EVENT BASICALLY COME TO THE TOP OF THE DOCUMENT.

-> THE SECOND PHASE IS THE TARGET PHASE , IN WHICH THE EVENT MOVE FROM TOP TO THE TARGET ELEMENT BY PASSING ON EVERY PARENT DOCUMENT ELEMENTS AND NOT THE SIBLINGS.

-> WHEN THE EVENT REACHES THE TARGET , THAT'S WHERE THE EVENT CAN BE HANDELED ('CLICK' EVENT).

-> IF WE APPLY AN EVENT TO SOME OF THE PARENT ELEMENT , IT WILL EXACTLY USE THE SAME EVENT
AS THE CHILD EVENT , BECAUSE AFTER THAT , IT BUBBLES UP TO THE TOP OF THE DOCUMENT, PASSING THROUGH EVERY PARENT ELEMENT.



-> SO WE CAN SAY THAT, WE ONLY HANDLES EVENT ON THE TARGET PHASE AND THE BUBBLING PHASE , AND NOT ON THE CAPTURING PHASE.

-> ALSO NOTE THAT , THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN ON ALL EVENTS.

-> THERE IS PICTURE IN THE IN THIS WORKSPACE, WHICH DEMONSTARTED THE WHOLE PROCESS.
